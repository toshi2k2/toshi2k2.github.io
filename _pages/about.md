Hi there! Welcome to my bio page!\\ I am a 4th year Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University.\\

My current work involves intersection of unsupervised learning, 3D generative models, continual learning, domain adaptation, and model robustness. I also dabble in causal inference and optimal transport. My research revolves around using cognitive computational vision concepts for solving signal processing and machine learning problems especially related to computer vision and graphics. \\

Currently, I am focusing on projects regarding part-based 3D object representation and completion, text-to-3D geenrative modelling and lifelong learning for Internet-scale large vision-language models.\\ 

Looking for collaborators and internships!
